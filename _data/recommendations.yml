      A mentor once told me, “If you want to be an excellent educator, learn to tell stories.” Fall Like Rain is a well written story from an excellent educator. Read this book and through story, you’ll learn widely – about Cambodia, about cross-cultural adjustment, about the challenges of growing up as a child of first-generation immigrants, and about the hardships faced by the world’s poorest people – like sweatshops and trafficking. But first and foremost, Fall Like Rain is a story of how Jesus can transform a worldview dominated by suffering and darkness into a worldview overwhelmed by hope. Get ready to read a story that will lift your spirit – no matter your circumstances.

      Stories are an effective and often used means of teaching in Asian cultures. So we have a case here of using a story to describe a culture using the form of teaching commonly used in that culture… I believe this book is an excellent tool of information and instruction to those who want to understand Asian cultures.

      I highly recommend using Fall Like Rain and the Discussion Guide (study materials) to prepare and equip cross-cultural workers. Although this story illustrates invaluable aspects of Asian cultures, it can also guide us in learning about nuances and values of any culture. It can prepare our minds and hearts for building deep cross-cultural relationships.

      I guess you could learn about Southeast Asian culture from a textbook. But why would you when you can pick up this book and in ten minutes be lost in the wonders of Cambodia and its kind and resilient people. The glories and tragedies of Southeast Asia are distilled in the pages of Fall Like Rain and its captivating story of Sophy and Kunthea. Highly recommended!
