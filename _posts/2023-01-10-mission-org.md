### INTRODUCTION

**Fall Like Rain** is a collection of true stories from the mission field, woven into one novel: 
True stories that can be used as case studies. The Fall Like Rain Study Guide provides
several ways to learn about key topics such as poverty, worldview, culture and the spiritual
realm through the case studies. 

It is for international ministry/ mission leaders and teachers, practitioners, and advocates.
It is designed for global studies or mission classes (church or college-based), and mission
or development worker teams (field or home front); for people who work with immigrants or
refugees: Anyone who wants to learn more about cross-cultural ministry of any kind.

Although the stories are set in Cambodia, workers from any field with a fear-power or
honor-shame culture can learn much about cross cultural work. One theme is
worker-as-learner, which is not specific to any one place. Key themes like poverty
alleviation and worldview transformation are relevant on many fields.
