### Small Group Bible Study Guide 

**Fall Like Rain** is a collection of true stories from the mission field, woven into one novel: 
True stories that can be used as case studies. The guide provides several ways to learn what
the Bible has to say about key topics such as poverty, worldview, culture and the spiritual
realm, using the stories in the book. 

LEADERS: There are several ways to use this guide.

- For a basic study, have all participants read the book on their own, 
and then use the BOOK CLUB discussion questions (page 3), along with the
scripture list (page 2). It is recommended to do this over 3-6 study sessions.
- For a deeper look, have all participants write in the THROUGH THE STORY
workbook as they read, and discuss highlights with the group. Then use the
scripture list as the various topics come up.
- For further study, see the CROSS-CULTURAL STUDY THROUGH STORY and the
RECOMMENDED READING LIST at nellcorbly.com.- coming soon
