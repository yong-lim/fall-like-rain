### INTRODUCTION

In my years as a field development worker/ missionary, I have seen various methods of teaching newer workers about culture. Too often these are very academic. Most people from the developed world feel very comfortable with research. Then reality hits when they get on the field.  They discover that learning language and understanding culture are things that can not just be conquered by extra hard work and study. Many new workers start out in language study with that conquering attitude- only to discover that it is a process that involves a lot of listening and patience. In the same way, understanding worldviews and cultures different from our own is not something that happens through academic study. Most importantly- It involves starting with our own hearts. My assumption is that missionaries have already been equipped with plenty of factual information on their host culture. This course is meant to have you take a deeper, more meaningful and personal dive. It is a call to see things differently- to put on new glasses. In fact from here on out, I will refer to the course as the New Glasses Course- just as a continual reminder that this is your goal!

### Overview and Goals
**Who:** Missionaries in training (on-field) from any field and their leaders/ trainers. Although it can be used pre-field as well, the learners will benefit most while immersed in their host culture, navigating the complexities of everyday life there. 

**Teachers:** my hope is to make your job much easier by providing ready-made and flexible materials that you can adapt to your own contexts. Because the materials emphasize the range of worldviews and cultures, it should be useful in many contexts, not just South East Asia.

**Description:** A practical course of study for long-term cross cultural workers. The overarching emphasis is on wearing “new glasses”: a willingness to acknowledge our own blind spots. Using Fall Like Rain as a starting point only, it explores six topics and Includes a variety of other articles, books, activities and resources. The topics studied are, in order, Worldview, Spiritual Realm, Culture, Poverty, Justice and Mercy, and Best Practice. Before diving into these six topics, we will do a study on wisdom. 
 The “New Glasses” Missionary Training Course is best used as training for new missionaries on the field, but parts of it could be used pre-field as well. Mission organizations could run the course for newer missionaries, partly as a self study, with regular meetings for discussion groups. Ideally the leaders would invite experienced missionaries or nationals, who could share stories which illustrate the concepts.  The leader/ teacher can choose learning activities and add their own, according to their goals. This curriculum can be done as is for a basic overview or as a starting point on these topics, but teachers are encouraged to add readings that are specific to their contexts.

**Fall Like Rain** is a collection of true stories from the mission field, woven into one novel: 
True stories that can be used as case studies. The Fall Like Rain Study Guide provides
several ways to learn about key topics such as poverty, worldview, culture and the spiritual
realm through the case studies. 

It is for international ministry/ mission leaders and teachers, practitioners, and advocates.
It is designed for global studies or mission classes (church or college-based), and mission
or development worker teams (field or home front); for people who work with immigrants or
refugees: Anyone who wants to learn more about cross-cultural ministry of any kind.

Although the stories are set in Cambodia, workers from any field with a fear-power or
honor-shame culture can learn much about cross cultural work. One theme is
worker-as-learner, which is not specific to any one place. Key themes like poverty
alleviation and worldview transformation are relevant on many fields.

### **Recommendations**
The following international and national experts have noted the educational possibilities in the book:

## **NOTE TO LEADERS AND TEACHERS**
You are inspiring the next generation of Christian workers in global mission. The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Whether they are future senders, givers, advocates, or missionaries, the great commission needs learners. Whether they will work on a foreign field or with foreign nationals locally, we need people who have the humility to ask questions- the kind of questions that lead to learning.

On one hand our western culture encourages gaining knowledge: but that same concept works inversely and gives us a know-it-all attitude. I believe that the combination of story and study is the most effective way to learn. The story grabs our attention and captures our hearts, but the questions cause us to contemplate the realities illustrated. 

As both Ajith Fernando and Paul Borthwick have noted (in the foreword and recommendation) Fall Like Rain is educational. I am an educator at heart and by training. When I set out to write the book, I knew there were many lessons that these true stories would illustrate more clearly than any academic study could. As teachers of cross cultural study, we face an added difficulty: the challenge of worldview change in the learning process. How do we open the hearts and minds of our students to see and understand things which are utterly outside their own realm of experience? As a long term worker I have hosted many short term visitors and often noticed that they tend to draw wrong conclusions about what they see, because their own worldview (perspective) is not being challenged. 

My prayer is that God would use the combination of story and study provided in Fall Like Rain and these study materials to help create the kind of kingdom workers who will be like clay in His hands. Molded, fired for use, and ready to be broken so they can shine His light in a dark world. – Nell Corbly
