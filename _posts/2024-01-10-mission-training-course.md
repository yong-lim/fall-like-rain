### INTRODUCTION

**Fall Like Rain** is a collection of true stories from the mission field, woven into one novel: 
True stories that can be used as case studies. The Fall Like Rain Study Guide provides
several ways to learn about key topics such as poverty, worldview, culture and the spiritual
realm through the case studies. 

It is for international ministry/ mission leaders and teachers, practitioners, and advocates.
It is designed for global studies or mission classes (church or college-based), and mission
or development worker teams (field or home front); for people who work with immigrants or
refugees: Anyone who wants to learn more about cross-cultural ministry of any kind.

Although the stories are set in Cambodia, workers from any field with a fear-power or
honor-shame culture can learn much about cross cultural work. One theme is
worker-as-learner, which is not specific to any one place. Key themes like poverty
alleviation and worldview transformation are relevant on many fields.

### **Recommendations**
The following international and national experts have noted the educational possibilities in the book:

## **NOTE TO LEADERS AND TEACHERS**
You are inspiring the next generation of Christian workers in global mission. The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Whether they are future senders, givers, advocates, or missionaries, the great commission needs learners. Whether they will work on a foreign field or with foreign nationals locally, we need people who have the humility to ask questions- the kind of questions that lead to learning.

On one hand our western culture encourages gaining knowledge: but that same concept works inversely and gives us a know-it-all attitude. I believe that the combination of story and study is the most effective way to learn. The story grabs our attention and captures our hearts, but the questions cause us to contemplate the realities illustrated. 

As both Ajith Fernando and Paul Borthwick have noted (in the foreword and recommendation) Fall Like Rain is educational. I am an educator at heart and by training. When I set out to write the book, I knew there were many lessons that these true stories would illustrate more clearly than any academic study could. As teachers of cross cultural study, we face an added difficulty: the challenge of worldview change in the learning process. How do we open the hearts and minds of our students to see and understand things which are utterly outside their own realm of experience? As a long term worker I have hosted many short term visitors and often noticed that they tend to draw wrong conclusions about what they see, because their own worldview (perspective) is not being challenged. 

My prayer is that God would use the combination of story and study provided in Fall Like Rain and these study materials to help create the kind of kingdom workers who will be like clay in His hands. Molded, fired for use, and ready to be broken so they can shine His light in a dark world. â€“ Nell Corbly
