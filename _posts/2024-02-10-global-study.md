### Global Studies Course


### INTRODUCTION
In my years as a field development worker/ missionary, I have hosted visitors from churches and schools around the world. Many short-term visitors tend to draw wrong conclusions about what they see, because their own worldview (perspective) is not being challenged. I believe that field workers, after challenging themselves to be true learners, are responsible to educate and challenge mis-perceptions in others. It is all too easy for workers on foreign fields to cater to the expectations of well-meaning home-front workers in their churches, rather than challenge them to learn and grow.

The great commission not only needs those who go to foreign fields. It needs workers who are willing to cross cultures in their own cities. Perhaps you work with Internationals- immigrants or refugees. God has brought the “ends of the earth” to you! I hope this study will help you to understand the ways in which they just think differently than you, so you can connect on deeper levels. 

Lastly, other workers for the harvest are needed; senders, pastors, teachers, pray-ers and advocates. This Study Through Story Curriculum is designed for people working in their home cultures who want a greater understanding of what cross cultural ministry needs. Together we will glorify God as we take the gospel to the ends of the earth.

**Overview and Goals**

**Who:** Church or college based global or cross-cultural studies classes

**Description:** A practical cross-cultural course of study. Using Fall Like Rain as a starting point, it explores six topics and Includes a variety of other readings, activities and resources. The topics studied are Worldview, Spiritual Realm, Culture, Poverty, Justice and Mercy, and Best Practice. The curriculum is designed to be flexible. The leader/ teacher can choose learning activities and add their own, according to their goals. It is strongly suggested, however, to approach the topics in the order written, since the concepts build sequentially. This curriculum can be done as is for a basic overview of these points, but teachers are encouraged to add readings that are specific to their contexts.
