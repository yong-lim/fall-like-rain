### COMPANION WORKBOOK

**FALL LIKE RAIN** is a novel based on true stories, which illustrates many topics relevant to cross-cultural workers. It is meant to be used for educational and awareness purposes. 

This workbook is intended to draw the reader to a deeper understanding of Cambodian culture through thought provoking questions. Lists of topical bible references and further reading are included at the end of this workbook. 

For best results, mission teams should follow up with group discussion, studying the materials together. Experienced members can share additional stories from their own cross-cultural experience. 

Each learner should begin by reading FALL LIKE RAIN and using this workbook, writing answers to the following questions as they read.
